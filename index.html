			<h2>About Mr. Rogers</h2>
			<p>Captain Rogers is the first and coolest avenger (let's be honest here). He also is hot as fuck and I would literally let me snap me in half with his beefy arms. He indubitably, 300% times yes, looks better with a beard. But I guess Marvel said fuck it to what the people wanted and just shaved that shit off in Endgame. It's ok, I'm not crying, you are.</p>

			<h2>His roll in Avengers</h2>
			<p>He is the baddest bitch and he will kill literally everyone that gets in his motherfucking goddamn bitchass way. Everyone else is a huge pussy compated to Cap over here. Except Thor. He's nice and he looks much better with shorter hair. I would also let Thor hammer me to death. Literally with his Mjolnir. No euphemisms intended.</p>

			<h2>His friends; The Avengers</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Iron Man</li>
				<li>Thor</li>
				<li>The rest (no one cares)</li>
				<li>That dude with the arrows</li>
			</ol>
